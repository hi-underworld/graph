# Path & circle

## some basic concepts

girth : the length of mini cycle in G 

circumference: the length of max cycle in G



Assumption: A, B is a set of vertices; P = x0x1x2...xk

if  V(P)∩A = {x0}  and  V(P)∩B = {xk}

then P is the A-B path



Assumption: P = x0x1...x(k-1);  C = P + x(k-1)x0

if  k >= 3 

then C is the cycle, and if Len(C) = k

then C is the k-cycle



Assumption: x,y are two vertices in G

d(x,y) is the length of shortest path between x,y in G 

If there is no such path in G, then d(x,y) = ∞

for any x,y in G, diam(G) is the largest d(x,y).
