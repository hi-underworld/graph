subgraph

Assumption: G' = (V', E'); G = (V, E)

if V' is subseteq to V and E' is subseteq to E

then G' is the subgraph of G



induced graph

Assumption: G' = (V', E'); G = (V, E)

For any x, y in V', E'' = {xy | xy in E }, if E'' = E'

then G' is the induced graph of G'



spanning graph

Assumption: G' = (V', E'); G = (V, E)

if V' = V

then G' is the spanning graph og G'



complete graph

Assumption: G = (V, E)

for any x,y in V, if xy in E

then G is complete graph 



complement graph

Assumption:  G = (V, E)

the  G' =(V, [V]^2) is the complete graph, G'' = (V, V]^2 \ E) is the complement graph of G
